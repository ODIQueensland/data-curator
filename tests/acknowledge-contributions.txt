Feature: Acknowledge Contributions

Scenario: Tom wants to see who has contributed to Data Curator
Given Tom has Data Curator open
When he presses About
Then Teresa should see the Contributors
And be able to follow a link so she can make a contribution

Scenario: Tom has seen the Contributors
Given Tom has the Data Curator About panel open
When he clicks outside the panel
Or clicks the Close button
Then the About panel closes
