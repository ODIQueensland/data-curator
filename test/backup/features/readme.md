Acceptance tests for [Data Curator](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/blob/master/README.md) are:

- written using the [Gherkin language](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference#gherkin) ([learn more](https://media.pragprog.com/titles/hwcuc/gherkin.pdf)) and stored [on GitHub](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/tree/master/test/features)

- [shared in a pretty format](https://relishapp.com/odi-australia/data-curator/docs) using [Relish](https://relishapp.com)

- arranged in folders like the application menu structure

- use the `@backlog` tag to indicate that it's not in our [release plans](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open)

- use the `@draft` tab for draft features that are stored in the Backlog directory
