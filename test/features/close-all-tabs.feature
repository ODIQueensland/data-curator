Feature: Close all tabs
  In order to quickly finish work
  As a Data Packager
  I want to safely close all open data tabs at once
  But Not lose my changes. If I have unsaved work, prompt me to save it. Save the data using the CSV dialect set in the associated Table Properties
  Or, if that is null, use the CSV dialect specified in Preferences.
  By default the CSV dialect will be a comma separated file with defaults settings as documented in http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/#specification

    When I select Close all Tabs from the menu
    Then all tabs close
