Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
  In order to realize a named business value
  As an explicit system actor
  I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal

  Scenario: Some determinable business situation
    Given some precondition (i.e the system is in a particular state)
    And some other precondition
    When some action by the actor (i.e. a event happens)
    When using macOS, the Command W shortcut is pressed
    When using Windows, ...
    When using Linux, ...
    When the Close icon in the data tab is selected
    And yet another action
    Then some testable outcome is achieved (i.e check the outcome)
    And something else we can check happens too
