Feature: Export Closed Data Package
  As a Data Packager
  I want to export the data and associated metadata in a data package using a non-open licence
  So that I can share usuable data under more restrictive terms that protect stakeholder interests

  Operates the same as Export Data Package but allows a non-open licence to be applied

  Scenario: Export Closed Data Package
    Given Data Curator is open
    And I have completed all the required column, table and data package properties
    And I have not selected an Open Data Licence
    And I have purchased the enterprise add in
    When I invoke the "Export Data Package" command
    Then prompt for location and name to save the file
    And assemble the data, properties and provenance information into a data package file
    And save it to the location
    And warn if an existing file will be overwritten
