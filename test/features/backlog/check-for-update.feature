Feature: Check for update
  As a Data Packager or Data Consumer
  I want to update to the lastest version of the application
  So that I gain access to the lastest bug fixes and new features

  Scenario: Check for update
    Given I have opened Data Curator
    When I select "Check for update" from the menu
    Then Do something
