Feature: Guess column properties
  In order to complete the properties for each column quickly
  As a Data Packager
  I want to quickly derive as many column properties as possible from the data and the CSV dialect.

  If the 'header' is 'true' in the CSV Dialect, then for each column, set the 'name' property to the value in the first row of the column.
  See:
  - http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#name
  - http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/#specification

  Read the first 100 rows of the data and for each column, infer the data 'type' and 'format' and set the 'type' and 'format' property values to the inferred values.
  See: http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#types-and-formats

  If column properties already exist for the guessed properties, then prompt the user to ask if they should be over-written.

# Am I using quotes correctly here?

  Scenario: Guess column properties
    Given I have opened Data Curator
    And 1 data tab is active
    When I select Guess Column Properties from the menu
    Then infer the column properties from the data
