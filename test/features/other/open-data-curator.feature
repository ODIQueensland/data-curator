Feature: Open Data Curator
  As a User
  I want to open the application only once
  So that I can focus working on one data package at a time

  The application can be opened by:
  - launching it using a icon
  - opening a file and specifying to use the application

  Rules:
  - The application can only be opened once
  - If the application is opened using the icon, an an empty 2x3 data tab is presented
  - If the application is opened via a file, then the file is open in the right-most position

  Scenario: Open the application using the icon, app not already running
    Given I have not opened Data Curator
    When I open Data Curator
    Then the application is opened
    And an empty data tab is presented

  Scenario: Open the application using the icon, app already running
    Given I have opened Data Curator
    When I attempt to open Data Curator again using the launch icon
    Then focus is given to the running instance of Data Curator

  Scenario: Open the application via file open, app not already running
    Given I have not opened Data Curator
    And I select a data file using the File System
    When I specify to open the file using Data Curator
    Then the application is opened
    And the specified file is open in a tab within the application

  Scenario: Open the application via file open, app already running
    Given I have opened Data Curator
    And I select a data file using the File System
    When I specify to open the file using Data Curator
    Then the specified file is opened in a new tab in the right-most position the running instance of Data Curator
