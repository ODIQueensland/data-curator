Acceptance tests for Data Curator are:

- written using the [Gherkin language](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference#gherkin) ([learn more](https://media.pragprog.com/titles/hwcuc/gherkin.pdf)) and stored [on GitHub](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/tree/master/test/features)

- [shared in a pretty format](https://relishapp.com/odi-australia/data-curator/docs) using [Relish](https://relishapp.com)

- arranged like the application menu structure (with backlog features at the end)
