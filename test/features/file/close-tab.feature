Feature: Close tab
  As a Data Packager
  I want to close the active data tab and prompt if there are unsaved changes
  So that I can safely finish working with that data

  If the changes are to be saved, they will use the appropriate CSV dialect settings.

  If available, use the CSV dialect settings in associated Table Properties.

  If these are unavailable, then use the CSV dialect specified in Preferences.

  By default the CSV dialect will be a comma separated file with defaults settings as documented in http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/#specification

  The CSV dialect selected may change the file extension e.g. tab separated values files use .tsv
