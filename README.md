# Data Curator


![data curator icon](/static/img/data-curator-120.png)

Data Curator is a simple desktop CSV editor to help describe, validate and share usable open data.


## Why do we need Data Curator?

Open data producers are increasingly focusing on improving open data publishing so that data can be used to create insight and drive positive change.

Open data is more likely to be used if data consumers can:

- understand why and how the data was collected
- understand the structure of the data
- look up the meaning of codes used in the data
- understand the quality of the data
- access the data in an open machine-readable format
- know how the data is licensed and how it can be reused

## Planned features

[Using Data Curator](https://odiqueensland.github.io/data-curator-help/) open data producers can:

- create new tabular data from scratch or from a template
- open data from a CSV or Microsoft Excel file
- open multiple related data tables from a [Data Package](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/)
- automatically correct [common problems](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/data-quality-spec/blob/master/README.md) found in CSV and Excel files
- edit data

Using data from any of these sources, you can:

- automatically create a [schema](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) that describes the data fields
- refine the schema to include extra [data validation rules](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/#constraints)
- describe the [provenance](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/readme-md-practice-for-data-packages/5555) of your data
- save data as a valid CSV file in various [CSV dialects](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/csv-dialect/)

The schema enables you to:

- validate the whole table at once
- validate a column at a time
- (and in a future release, validate as you type)

Once the data is described and validated, you can share the data and its description by exporting a [Data Package](http://frictionlessdata.io/data-packages/) to:

- [publish](http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2016/07/25/publish-data-packages-to-datahub-ckan.html) on your [open data portal](https://ckan.org)
- use as a template for others to make similar data

Open data consumers can use published Data Packages to:

- view the data structure and provenance information to help determine if the data is fit for their purpose
- download the data together with its metadata in a single zip file
- use [a suite of tools](http://frictionlessdata.io/tools/) to work with the data

## Download and Install Data Curator

- Choose a platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/releases/latest).
- Drag the application to your applications folder.

### On macOS

If you encounter a warning message informing you the application cannot be opened due to being from an unknown developer, try:

- Right click the app
- then option + click on Open.

This occurs due to macOS quarantining applications when it cannot determine the certificate used to sign the application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Development

We develop against the 'develop' branch. The 'master' branch contains tagged releases. We are currently using this [branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) by Vincent Driessen.

### Requirements

`node`<br>
`yarn`<br>
`electron`

You can use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install all relevant packages and development dependencies. See the [yarn installation page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

We're considering keeping our dependencies up to date with [Dependabot](https://dependabot.com).

### Development: Running the full application locally

To open the app on your local machine, run in development mode:

`yarn` _(pulls down all dependencies)_

`yarn run dev`

### Application Architecture

Data Curator is built using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io), a framework that allows developers to build desktop applications using web technology.

There are two parts of the application, the main process and the renderer process. The main process deals with things like carrying out file operations, validating CSVs, and rendering views. The renderer acts very much like client side javascript in a web browser, dealing with things like presentation, and user interactions.

#### IPC messaging

Electron passes and listens for messages between main and renderer using the IPC module, one for the [main process](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/ipc-main.md) and one for the [renderer process](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/ipc-renderer.md).

## Coding Standards

We have adopted [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com) as our JavaScript coding standard.

## Tests

Tools to automate testing have not been selected.

### Acceptance tests

We're considering:

- defining [Acceptance tests](https://github.com/ODIQueensland/data-curator/tree/master/test/features) using the [Gherkin language](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference#gherkin)
- sharing [Acceptance tests in a pretty format](https://relishapp.com/odi-australia/data-curator/docs) [using](https://relishapp.com/relish/relish/docs) [Relish](https://relishapp.com) (or [Cucumber Pro](https://cucumber.io/pro) if it's [useful](https://app.cucumber.pro/projects/cucumber-pro), when it's ready and if it's affordable)
- we may link acceptance tests to lower level tests
- [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/) will probably be helpful

To push the acceptance tests (.feature files) to Relish:

`relish push odi-australia/data-curator path /your-local-path/data-curator/test/features`

### Integration and Unit tests

We're considering:

- [Spectron](https://electron.atom.io/spectron/) is a purpose built Electron testing framework
- [Comma Chameleon](https://github.com/theodi/comma-chameleon#tests) currently uses [Electron-Mocha](https://github.com/jprichardson/electron-mocha), [Chai](http://chaijs.com) and [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org) for unit tests
- Spectron can be used with any testing library, including [Mocha](https://mochajs.org), [Chai](http://chaijs.com), [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io), and [AVA](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava)
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration

`Instructions on how to run tests will go here.`

## Deployment

### Building a new package

A tool to automate deployment has not been selected. We're considering:

- [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com) for Windows deployment
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org) for macOS and Linux

`Instructions on how to build a package will go here.`
